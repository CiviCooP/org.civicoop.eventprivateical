# org.civicoop.eventprivateical

This extension has a link which shows all events in an ical format. Including the non-public event.
In the default civicrm installation the ical link only shows public events. Which I think is good. This extension adds
a link in the form of *http://yourcivicrm.com/civicrm/event/private_ical?reset=1&list=1*

## options

* **gData=1** to enable google data output
* **type=xxx** the event type you want to include in your list
* **start** the start date
* **end** the end date
* **list=1** to use as ical page
* **html=1** to show a html list
* **rss=1** to show the list as an RSS feed

## To use in Google Calendar

Use the link: 

*http://yourcivicrm.com/civicrm/event/private_ical?reset=1&list=1*
